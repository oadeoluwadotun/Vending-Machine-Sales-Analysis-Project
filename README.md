## Project Overview
This project analyses sales data from vending machines in diverse locations across Central New Jersey. The objective is to understand consumer behaviour, evaluate vending machine performance, and uncover insights for business optimization. The dataset includes data from four distinct locations:

1. **GuttenPlans**: A frozen dough specialist company operating 24/5.
2. **EB Public Library**: A public library with high foot traffic (5-6 days a week).
3. **Brunswick Square Mall**: A shopping mall with daily medium foot traffic.
4. **Earle Asphalt**: A construction engineering firm operating 5 days a week.

## Key Insights

### 1. **Location-Based Sales**
- GuttenPlans and EB Public Library had the highest sales.
- Earle Asphalt had the lowest sales.
- Tailored inventory management is essential to meet location-specific demand while avoiding waste.
- Promotions could enhance sales at Brunswick Square Mall and Earle Asphalt.

### 2. **Machine-Specific Performance**
- GuttenPlans (x1367) and EB Public Library (x1380) led in sales.
- Lower-performing machines like those at Brunswick Square Mall and Earle Asphalt require further investigation and potential improvement in pricing, visibility, and customer experience.

### 3. **Seasonal Trends**
- Peak sales occurred during the summer (especially July).
- Winter recorded the lowest sales.
- Seasonal planning and targeted marketing efforts are recommended.

### 4. **Product Insights**
- Top products: Monster Energy Original and Coca-Cola Zero Sugar.
- Bottom products: Natureâ€™s Valley Crunchy Granola Bar.
- Strategic decisions could focus on underperforming productsâ€”consider redesigning, marketing, or discontinuation.

### 5. **Transaction Analysis**
- Cash transactions dominated across all locations, particularly at GuttenPlans.
- Promotions could encourage more credit transactions for convenience and efficiency.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Handled null values by removing six rows (all from EB Public Library machine).
- Verified dataset integrity: no duplicates and retained all outliers for relevance.
- Converted date columns to `DateTime` format for better analysis.

## Recommendations
- **Marketing**: Emphasise credit transactions with discounts or loyalty rewards.
- **Inventory Management**: Optimise stock levels per location and machine performance.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Implement robust cash-handling processes at locations with high cash usage.
- **Product Strategy**: Focus on customer preferences to refine offerings and eliminate poorly performing items.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Data cleaning and analysis.
- **Data Visualization Tools**: Tableau for graphical insights.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides actionable insights to drive better operations, improved sales performance, and strategic decision-making across vending machine locations.
